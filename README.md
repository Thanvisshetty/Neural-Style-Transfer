# Neural Style Transfer (NST)
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique used to apply the artistic style of one image (style image) to the structure/content of another image (content image).

For example, you could take:

1.A photo of a landscape (content)

2.A painting by Van Gogh (style)
...and blend them into a final image that looks like the landscape painted in Van Goghâ€™s style.

Traditional NST uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like VGG19 to extract and merge content and style features.

## ðŸ§ª What This Program Does (Overview)
Since you wanted a simple version that runs without large models or external datasets, this program:

### Creates two artificial images:

1.A blue circle (used as the content image)

2.An orange square (used as the style image)

3.Simulates style transfer by blending the two images together pixel by pixel.

### Displays all three images side-by-side:

1.Original content image

2.Style image

3.Stylized output (blended result)

## ðŸŽ¨ Output Summary
The output shows a grid of three images:

Content Image: A blue circle on a white background

Style Image: An orange square on a white background

Stylized Result: A circular shape with both orange and blue blended together â€” mimicking the idea of content + style fusion.

## âœ… Why This Is Useful
Great for understanding the core idea of Neural Style Transfer

Does not require large datasets or GPU

Useful in assignments or demos where you just need to show concepts and outputs without heavy dependencies
